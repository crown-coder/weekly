**Git Demo Project**
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Git commands in a real-world workflow. 
It includes a simple HTML webpage with features like a navbar and footer, 
developed using Git branching, merging, and other advanced commands. 
The workflow simulates a collaborative development process.

Initial project setup and Git repository creation.
Branching for feature development (feature/navbar, feature/footer).
Merging branches into the main branch.
Conflict resolution during merges.
Advanced Git commands:
Stashing changes.
Tagging releases.

**Git Workflow**

1. Project Initialization
mkdir git-demo-project
cd git-demo-project
git init
Created the repository and added a remote connection.

2. Branching and Feature Development
Create a New Branch

git checkout -b feature/navbar
Add Changes
Modified index.html to include a navbar:

<nav>
    <div class="logo">
      <h1>CrownCoder</h1>
